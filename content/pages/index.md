          You've just about seen it all.


          Sales slumps, tech troubles, cash crunches, and people problems aren't
          even half of it. When the chips are down, your team knows they can
          trust your judgment.


          We've run businesses through good times, the financial crisis, better
          times, and the global pandemic. We know what it means to make the
          tough call, and we are serious about that responsibility.

      - title: ( 2 ) No Spectators.
        content: >
          You don't need spectators. Boards of directors, professional
          investors, consultants, yes-men, naysayers, and all other onlookers
          need not apply. Your business needs to be run by people in the
          business.


          We use our own money and don't take on outside investors. A faceless
          hedge fund, equity group, or board won't call the shots. Without red
          tape and Monday-morning quarterbacking, we are free to do what's right
          for our teams.

      - title: ( 3 ) Integrity Guaranteed.
        content: >
          You follow through on your word, no games. That's what has made the
          difference. How you're still standing when others fell. Why that
          customer stuck it out with you when times were tough.


          We'll follow through on the deal we offer you, no excuses. We've got
          great references, but we'll also guarantee a close or we'll pay you
          for time wasted.
